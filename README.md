# Dynamic Multilevel Caching System

## Overview

This project implements a dynamic multilevel caching system. The system allows for multiple cache levels, each with its own size and eviction policy (either LRU or LFU). It also supports dynamic cache level management, cache insertion, data retrieval, and eviction.

### Features:
- **Cache Levels**: Add multiple levels of cache with configurable sizes.
- **Eviction Policies**: Support for LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) eviction policies.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieve data from cache levels in priority order.
- **Dynamic Cache Level Management**: Add or remove cache levels at runtime.
- **In-memory Storage**: All cache data is stored in-memory without external service integration.

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `testcases.py` script:
   ```bash
   python3 testcases.py


### Summary:

- This solution meets all the requirements of the task.
- Provided a Dynamic Multilevel Caching System code in python.
